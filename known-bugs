Known Bugs, Issues and Limitations

* Heisenbug: shared memory error from >100 column stores
  Simon Riggs can reproduce this, no one else can.

* ERROR:  cache lookup failed for column store 160595
  This error shows up inexplicably when a table with over 100 column stores is
  dropped.  (Alvaro's guess is that it's related to pg_depend handling.  Gotta
  rework that and remove OIDs from pg_cstore).
